NumPy contains a large number of various mathematical operations. This mathematical function helps user to calculate trignmetric sine and cos
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:
* A powerful N-dimensional array object
* sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
* Tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
* Useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities
Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data.
