I am Yamuna who is data scientist. I have been invited as a guest lecturer at a college to take a session on numpy.
The following topics are i am going to cover:
    1.Initialize a numpy array of 5*5 dimensions with all the values to be 0
    2.Create a numpy arrary with initail value 10 and final 100 with an interval of 5 between each value.
    3.Create a 2-D array with values(10,20,30,40,50,60) and set the dimension to be 2*3
        a) Print the number of elements in the array
        b) Get the data-type of the array
    4.Create first numpy array with values(1,2,3).Create second numpy array with values       (4,5,6).Perform simple arithmetic operations on these two numpy arrays:
        a) Addition
        b) Subtraction
        c) Multiplication
        d) Division
    5.Create a numpy array with values 10-90 and set the shape to be 3*3
        a) Extract only the 3rd column column from the numpy array
        b)Extract only the 2nd row from the numpy array
        c)Extract those cells at the intersection of first two rows and first two columns
